    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a program that finds a downhill path on a city map. For simplicity, we assume that all streets are straight, go either in the north-south (vertical) or east-west (horizontal) direction and traverse the entire city. Every “north-south” \n",
    "street crosses every “east-west” street and there are no intersections with more than two streets meeting. We also assume that the number of horizontal streets is equal to the number of vertical streets. An altitude is assigned to each intersection. \n",
    "In this case, the map of the city can be represented as a matrix where each element of the matrix represents the altitude of the intersection between one horizontal and one vertical \n",
    "street. We also assume so-called periodic boundary conditions. That means that neighbours to the right of the last column are in the first column of the matrix, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "A traveller is allowed to move between neighbouring intersections downhill only. That is if the traveller starts at the intersection *(i,j)*, in each step he is allowed to move to any of the immediate neighbouring intersections (i.e., north, west, south or east) as long as the altitude of the neighbouring intersection is lower than the altitude of her current location. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given the initial (start) position, if it exists, find a downhill path between those two positions. If the path does not exist, report that there is not downhill path connecting intersection.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Backtracking algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "We start from the initial position and move in one of the four possible directions provided that such move is downhill. We repeat the process until either we reach the final position or there are no possible moves left, which means that the traveller got stuck at a crossing that is at a lower altitude than all of its neighbours. If we reached the final position, we print the path and exit. If, however, we got stuck, we backtrack to the last position from which we still could make at lease one allowed (i.e., downhill) move and try again. If no more downhill moves are possible and we did not reach the final destination, \n",
    "there are no possible paths. We report that no paths could be found and exit.\n"
